Electronic Request for Information (“eRFI”)
Event Name: Drinking Water Viewer / RECAP Report
eRFI (Event) Number: 46200-DNR0000804
1. Introduction
1.1. Purpose of Solicitation
This electronic Request for Information (“eRFI”) is being issued to solicit information from interested
suppliers with respect to Drinking Water Viewer / RECAP Report for the Department of Natural Resources
– Environmental Protection Division (EPD) (hereinafter, “the State Entity”) as further described in this eRFI.
The State Entity will use the information generated by this eRFI in conjunction with other information
available to the State Entity to determine the solution that it is in the best interests of the State Entity to
fulfill this need.
1.2. Overview of the eRFI Process
The objective of the eRFI is to gather information to assist the State Entity in its consideration of available
resources/methods to fulfill the need/goal identified above. The eRFI method is not a competitive
solicitation method and, as a result, does not satisfy the requirement for competitive bidding. The eRFI
method is no more than an information gathering tool and such information gathered may or may not be
used by the State Entity to develop a competitive solicitation. Suppliers are not required to respond to an
eRFI and a supplier’s failure to respond to an eRFI will not prohibit the supplier’s participation in any
competitive solicitation that may result from the eRFI. However, suppliers are strongly encouraged to
respond to eRFIs as this is a great way to ensure the State Entity is aware of the suppliers’ available goods
and services.
1.3. Schedule of Events
The schedule of events set out herein represents the State Entity’s best estimate of the schedule that will
be followed. However, delays to the procurement process may occur which may necessitate adjustments
to the proposed schedule. If a component of this schedule, such as the close date, is delayed, the rest of
the schedule may be shifted as appropriate. Any changes to the dates up to the closing date of the eRFI
will be publicly posted prior to the closing date of this eRFI. After the close of the eRFI, the State Entity
reserves the right to adjust the remainder of the proposed dates on an as needed basis with or without
notice.

2.2.3. Preparing a Response
As noted earlier, Team Georgia MarketplaceTM allows the supplier to answer questions by entering
text and numeric responses. In addition, as noted in Section 2.2.4 “Uploading Forms”, the supplier
may also provide information by uploading electronic files. When preparing a response, the
supplier must consider the following instructions:
1. The supplier must ensure its response is accurate and readily understandable.
2. The supplier must label any and all uploaded files using the corresponding section numbers of
the eRFI or any other logical name so that the State Entity can easily organize and navigate the
supplier’s response.
3. The supplier must use commonly accepted software programs to create electronic files. The
State Entity has the capability of viewing documents submitted in the following format: Microsoft
Word or WordPad, Microsoft Excel, portable document format file, and plain text files with the
file extension noted in parentheses (.txt). Unless the eRFI specifically requests the use of
another type of software or file format than those listed above, please contact the Issuing
Officer prior to utilizing another type of software and/or file format.
4. The supplier must save its response until the supplier is ready to submit its bid. Select the
“Save for Later” button at the top of the page under “Event Details” of the Event.

2.2.4. Uploading Forms
Once the supplier is ready to upload electronic files (completed forms or worksheets, product
sheets, etc.), please following the directions within the eRFI to upload these documents in the
proper location. There are two places to upload completed documents:

Revised 10/12/18 5 of 8 SPD-PS013
2. Second, the supplier can also upload documents by selecting the comment bubble icon,
which appears to the right of each eRFI question.

2.2.5. Reviewing the Response Prior to Submission
During the time period allowed for preparing the response, neither DOAS nor the State Entity can
view what information or documents are being added by the registered user. In other words, the
State Entity cannot know whether the supplier’s response is correct or complete until after the eRFI
has closed. Therefore, each supplier is responsible for ensuring all questions have been answered
appropriately and that all necessary documents have been uploaded.

2.2.6. Submitting the Completed Response/Bid
Once the completed response has been reviewed by the supplier, click the "Submit Bid"
button at the top of the page under the “Event Details” section of the Event. Please note that
submission is not instantaneous; therefore, each supplier must allow ample time for its response
to be submitted prior to the deadline.
2.2.7. Reviewing, Revising or Canceling a Submitted Response
After the response has been submitted, the supplier may view and/or revise its response by logging
into Team Georgia MarketplaceTM and selecting the eRFI event number and the “View/Edit” feature
for the supplier’s previous response. Please take note of the following:
1. REVIEW ONLY. In the event the supplier only wishes to view a submitted response, the
supplier may select “View/Edit”. Once the supplier has finished viewing the response, the
supplier may simply exit the screen. DO NOT SELECT “Save for Later.” Team Georgia
MarketplaceTM recognizes any response placed in the “Save for Later” status as a work in
progress and withdraws the originally submitted bid. As a result, unless the supplier
selects “Submit” prior to the closing date and time, no response will be transmitted to the
State Entity.
2. REVIEW AND REVISE. In the event the supplier desires to revise a previously submitted
response, the supplier may select “View/Edit” and then revise the response. If the revisions
cannot be completed in a single work session, the supplier should save its progress by
selecting “Save for Later.” Once revisions are complete, the supplier MUST select “Submit”
to submit its corrected response. Please permit adequate time to revise and then resubmit
the response. Please note submission is not instantaneous and may be affected by
several events, such as the supplier temporarily losing a connection to the Internet.
PLEASE USE CAUTION IN DECIDING WHETHER OR NOT TO MAKE REVISIONS. The
State will assume no responsibility for a supplier’s inability to correct errors or otherwise
make revisions to the submitted response prior to the eRFI end date and time.
3. WITHDRAW/CANCEL. In the event the supplier desires to revise a previously submitted
response, the supplier may select “View/Edit” and then select “Save for Later”. Team
Georgia Marketplace recognizes any response placed in the “Save for Later” status as a
work in progress and withdraws the originally submitted bid. As a result, unless the
supplier selects “Submit” prior to the closing date and time, no response will be transmitted
to the State Entity.
2.2.8. Help Desk Support
For technical questions related to the use of Team Georgia MarketplaceTM, suppliers have access
to phone support through the DOAS Customer Service Help Desk at 404-657-6000,

3. Requested Information
Agency Overview
The Environmental Protection Division (EPD) of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources is a state agency
charged with protecting Georgia's air, land, and water resources through the authority of state and federal
environmental statutes. These laws regulate public and private facilities in the areas of air quality, water quality,
hazardous waste, water supply, solid waste, surface mining, underground storage tanks, and others. EPD issues and
enforces all state permits in these areas and has full delegation for federal environmental permits except Section 404
(wetland) permits.
The Opportunity
In the early 1990s, EPA set out to provide important drinking water agencies with an information system that would
not only report accurate data to the federal system on a timely basis but would also support the rule implementation
activities of primacy agencies so that these agencies would not have to develop an information system on their own.
That system, known as the Safe Drinking Water Information System (SDWIS/STATE), needed to be efficient enough
to enable compliance determination for a host of growing EPA regulations, and it needed to gain acceptance by
addressing the specific needs of a large and varied base of primacy organizations.
Drinking Water Program (DWP) is looking to implement a new solution to, process, and analyze water-related data
from the existing SDWIS to provide comprehensive insights into availability, quality, consumption, and distribution. By
integrating with SDWIS, this solution aims to improve decision-making, optimize resources management, and
enhance transparency in water-related operations. The Drinking Water Program is taking this opportunity to provide
live water system information at your fingertips. Drinking Water Viewer (DWV) will view current SDWIS water system
data including sample results, compliance data, and inventory.
Purpose of Request for Information
The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to explore potential DWV Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS)
solutions that will integrate with SDWIS. This integration aims to enhance access to real-time and historical water
quality data, improve decision-making capabilities, and ensure compliance with regulatory standards. The drinking
water viewer will enable the program and the public to visualize and analyze water quality information efficiently.
RECAP
Report, Evaluation, Compliance, and Processing (RECAP) is a road map item and not an immediate need.
Benefits
• RECAP has more advanced functionality than Microsoft Access Databases.
• RECAP’s four add-on features use web services to extract information from databases and present it in useful
formats.
• Quickly generate reports and metrics to assist agency staff with compliance determination and keeping water
systems in compliance with the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) regulations.
• RECAP can be integrated with other applications to display information.
Reports
• Generates custom reports, outputs, and letters to help important agencies quickly review water system data
and compliance information.
• Letters, reminders, and reports can be sent to water systems to help them remain in compliance with SDWA
regulations.
