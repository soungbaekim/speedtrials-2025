# Data

**Across 10 CSV files, this directory includes a full Q1 2025 export of the SDWIS for the state of Georgia.** 

This README includes information on the File Structure, a Data Dictionary, as well as some (potentially) helpful external links at the bottom.

## üíæ About the SDWIS
The Safe Drinking Water Information System (SDWIS) contains information on public water systems, including monitoring, enforcement, and violation data related to requirements established by the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA). 

---

## üóÑÔ∏è File Structure
Key fields for each table are listed in bold below. Key fields uniquely identify the records within each file, and may be used to join and relate data between files.

For example, in the SDWA_PUB_WATER_SYSTEMS.csv file, each row describes a public water system in a particular quarter, and is uniquely identified by the values of the key fields SUBMISSIONYEARQUARTER and PWSID. Site visits, violations, and so on for that same system and quarter are identified by the same values of SUBMISSIONYEARQUARTER and PWSID in the other files.

_Data Quality Caveat_: EPA makes no claims regarding the accuracy or precision of data concerning Indian country locations or tribal boundaries on the ECHO website. EPA has simply attempted to collect certain readily available information relating to Indian country locations. Questions concerning data should be referred to the originating program or Agency which can be referenced in EPA‚Äôs Shared Enterprise Geodata Services (SEGS) metadata files¬†[Lower 48 Tribal Areas](https://edg.epa.gov/data.gov/B178E6D2-29E8-4966-8575-5446AC1A23FA),¬†[Alaska Native Villages](https://edg.epa.gov/data.gov/A1AB427E-FA43-4481-B0CA-0576EDAEE18A), or¬†[Alaska Native Allotments](https://edg.epa.gov/data.gov/1156219C-0885-4013-B277-AAD9F17F0511). The Indian country and tribal boundary locations are suitable only for general spatial reference and do not necessarily reflect EPA's position on any Indian country locations or tribal boundaries or the land status of any specific location. The inclusion of Indian country information on the ECHO website does not represent any final EPA action addressing Indian country locations or boundaries. This information cannot be relied upon to create any rights, substantive or procedural, enforceable by any party in litigation with the United States or third parties. EPA reserves the right to change information on ECHO at any time without public notice.

EPA uses the American Indian Reservation boundaries provided by the U.S. Census Bureau and the Department of Interior‚Äôs Bureau of Land Management (BLM) when developing environmental data query responses for tribes in the lower 48 United States and Alaska. EPA seeks to use the best available national federal data and may refine the tribal boundary layer in the future as more accurate national federal data becomes available.
